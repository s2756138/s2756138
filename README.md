## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Linda Chen, and I'm a third-year exchange student from Sydney, Australia. Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Bachelor of Advanced Computing with majors in Computational Data Science and Marketing at The University of Sydney

#### Learning Interests 

I have a keen interest in data science, particularly in the areas of fairness in predictive model building and the applications and ethics of AI. Iâ€™m eager to delve deeper into the biomedical data science sphere, exploring how data can drive advancements in healthcare.

#### What am I working on?

Iâ€™m not currently working on any projects since Iâ€™m on exchange, but Iâ€™m always keen to explore new opportunities if they arise!

#### Favorite hobbies

I love playing tennis, and now that Iâ€™m in Scotland, Iâ€™m excited to explore new places, being closer to different countries than I was in Australia! I also have a strong interest in art and art history, which Iâ€™m looking forward to pursuing further during my time here.
